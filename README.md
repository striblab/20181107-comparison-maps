# Comparison maps

Some mapshaper and ndjson scripts designed to get ahead of some potential questions the day after Election Day. Such as:

  * Precincts that voted R in 2016 but voted DFL for governor/senate in 2018 (or vice-versa)
  * Precincts that voted DFL in one Senate race and R in another
  * Can be adapted to do the same for AG vs. other races

The scripts produce two things: SVG maps of each case and a geojson with minimal information showing who voted how in what year.
